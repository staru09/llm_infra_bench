    "prompt": "Keep those headings in mind. Additionally, to further your knowledge on this topic, I will give you the content from HIA website. I only want you to reply \"acknowledged\" to remember the third I will give you further instructions after this.\n\nMutual termination or cancellation of a building contract\nFind out more about the use of a deed of termination when terminating or cancelling a building contract.\nCancelling or terminating a building contract is a significant step which should not be taken lightly.\nBefore taking any formal steps to end a building contract, you should talk to your client and see if you can reach an agreement to mutually end the contract.\nAny agreement to terminate a contract should be put in writing. One way to do this is through a deed of mutual termination.\nHow is a contract terminated?\nA contract can be terminated in a number of ways, including by performance, breach, agreement, frustration or by law. In the building industry, contracts are more commonly terminated by performance, breach or agreement.\n\nTermination by performance\nA contract will come to its natural end when both parties have performed or completed all of their duties and obligations under the contract. A deed is not required in this instance.\n\nTermination by breach\nAn innocent party may terminate a contract, depending on the terms of the contract, as a result of a breach by the other party.\n\nTermination by agreement\nThe parties mutually agree to terminate the contract for any other reason. A deed of mutual termination may be used for both a termination by breach and termination by agreement.\n\nWhat is a deed of mutual termination?\nA deed of mutual termination is a separate written binding legal document which confirms both parties mutual intention to cancel the original contract.\n\nThe deed will bring the parties responsibilities and obligations under the contract to an end and depending on the terms of the deed, will relieve them of carrying out any obligations that would have otherwise arisen under the contract in the future.\n\nWhen should I use a deed of mutual termination?\nA deed of mutual termination should be used when:\n\nBoth parties agree to end the contract and there is still something required to be completed under the contract such as payment, building works or rectification of defects;\nThe parties do not want to trigger any clause which may ordinarily arise as a result of termination, for example the deed may allow the parties to avoid issuing formal breach notices and formal termination which may lead to claims for costs and damages by one party; or\nThe contract does not provide a right to terminate.\nCase Study\nA builder and home owner entered into a building contract;\nWhilst the works were on foot, the builder and the home owner entered into a dispute regarding the completion date for the works;\nThe home owner and the builder agree to terminate the contract, however as works are incomplete, a deed of mutual termination is appropriate to record:\nthe terms of any payment to be made by the home owner to the builder for the works completed;\nthe requirements for the builder to complete any works;\nthe works the builder will not be required to complete; and\nthat the home owner has agreed not to pursue the builder for anything that the builder would have otherwise been liable for under the contract, including requirements to rectify defects or provide statutory warranties for works not completed.\nWhat should be included in a deed?\nThe terms of a deed will vary depending on a range of factors such as the stage of works at which termination will occur, any money owing or agreed to be paid, any further works required to be carried out prior to termination or any defects to be rectified.\n\nBelow are just some examples of the type of details that should be included:\n\nImportant background details\nBackground details, known as \u2019recitals\u2019 are not required for a deed, but can be useful in providing the background to the agreement.\n\nThe background details are often used to interpret the parties intention when entering into the agreement.\n\nAccordingly, it is important that the recitals contain the key facts that describe the circumstances leading to the parties agreeing to enter into the deed.\n\nRelease\nParties may agree to release and waive one another from any claims relating to the subject matter (i.e. the building contract).\n\nThe parties cannot demand performance of any outstanding obligations or claim damages.\n\nPreventing either party from bring any further actions\nA \u2018bar to action\u2019 or \u2018bar to proceedings\u2019 clause is critical as it prevents the parties from bringing any further action, claim or demands in relation to the terminated contract.\n\nResponsibility for any future losses that might arise under the original contract\nA \u2018no waiver\u2019 clause may be included in a deed to allow one party to take action against the other if they have breached the original contract. These types of clauses can have serious implications on you as the execution of the deed does not prevent a claim being made for a breach of the original contract and does not necessarily mean that the matter has come to an end.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you seek legal advice in the event you receive a deed with a \u2018no waiver\u2019 or similar clause.\n\nSettlement Payment\nWhere one party is to pay a sum of money to the other party, there should be clear terms identifying:\n\nThe sum of money to be exchanged\nThe date and method of payment\nWhat happens in the event of non-payment (for example, the party can commence legal proceedings to recover the sum of money or claim interest on the settlement sum)\nThat the settlement payment is made in full and final settlement of the parties\u2019 dispute.\nMutual Disparagement\nA mutual disparagement clause may be important if parties have been involved in a lengthy dispute or the relationship has broken down. This clause prevents either parties from \u201cbad-mouthing\u201d the other or damaging the others reputation.\n\nConfidentiality\nGenerally, the terms of a deed should be kept confidential and this will be stipulated in a confidentiality clause. This requires both parties to keep the terms of the deed confidential and may include the terms of the contract.\n\nWhat happens if a breach of the deed occurs?\nBreach of a deed may give the innocent party the right to commence legal proceedings to recover damages for any loss suffered as a result of the breach.\n\nBeware, deeds will not release you from all obligations\nAll statutory obligations and warranties provided by a builder to a home owner will continue to apply following the termination of a contract and cannot be contracted out of.",

Indeed, the general problem of extending standard proof-\ntheoretical results obtained for pure logic to certain classes of non-logical axioms\n\nhas been the focus of attention for quite some time now.\nThe main obstacle for this agenda is that adding non-logical axioms to systems\nwhile still maintaining the good proof theoretical properties is not an easy task. In\nfact, adding naively axioms to sequent systems often result in non cut-free\nsystems. One way of circumventing this problem is by treating axioms as theories,\nadded to the sequent context. This is already in Gentzen's consistency proof of\nelementary arithmetic. Now the derivations have only logical axioms as premises,\nand cut elimination applies.\nBut we can do better by transforming axioms into inference rules. In this talk, we\nwill propose a systematic way of adding inference rules to sequent systems. The\nproposal will be based on the notions of focusing and polarities. We will also\ndiscuss how our framework escalates to hypersequents and systems of rules.\nThis is a joint work with Dale Miller, Sonia Marin and Marco Volpe.",

    "prompt": "rewrite exactly this article and just Insert the subheadings In this article, we will discuss Foxconn Technology Group's plan to invest $700 million in a new manufacturing plant in India to increase local production. The Taiwanese company, which is a partner of Apple Inc. and is also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., will build the plant on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka. The new production site is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, making it one of Foxconn's biggest single outlays to date in India.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the factory will manufacture parts of the iPhone and will also assemble the handsets. Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business. The investment represents an accelerating shift of manufacturing away from China as tensions between the US and China continue to grow.\n\nThe decision to invest in India is significant and underscores how China's status as the world's largest producer of consumer electronics is at risk. US brands like Apple are looking for alternative locations to manufacture their products and are encouraging their Chinese-based suppliers to explore other locations such as India and Vietnam. This is a rethink of the global supply chain that has accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.\n\nFoxconn's move is the latest indication that suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected. The company's sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs over 200,000 workers, although that number surges during peak production season. However, output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain.\n\nIt should be noted that the plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details. It's also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities. Apple declined to comment on the matter, while Hon Hai, whose Chairman Young Liu met India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Karnataka state government also did not immediately respond. Liu, who is on tour in India, has committed to another manufacturing project in the neighboring Telangana state.\n\nFoxconn's decision is expected to be a coup for Modi's government, which sees an opportunity to close India's tech gap with China as Western investors and corporations sour on Beijing's crackdowns on the private sector. India has offered financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which began making the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu last year. Smaller rivals Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. have also ramped up in India, while suppliers such as Jabil Inc. have begun making components for AirPods locally.\n\nIn conclusion, Foxconn's $700 million investment in a new manufacturing plant in India represents a significant shift of manufacturing away from China and underscores the potential for China to lose its position as the world's leading producer of consumer electronics. As more companies explore alternative locations to manufacture their products, India is emerging as a strong contender. The investment will create thousands of jobs in India and is expected to be a coup for Modi's government, which is keen to position India as a leading manufacturing country.",

They face long-distance challenges as Alex travels frequently for work, and they struggle to find time for each other. They also encounter cultural differences, as Maya comes from a different background and upbringing than Alex. They sometimes struggle to understand each other's perspectives and values, but they work through their differences with patience, empathy, and open communication.\nIn addition, there are external factors that make their relationship more challenging. Alex's ex-girlfriend, who he had a tumultuous relationship with, tries to sabotage their relationship by spreading rumors and lies about Maya. Maya's job becomes more demanding, and she is forced to work long hours and weekends, leaving her with little time and energy for Alex.\nDespite these challenges, Alex and Maya persevere. They lean on each other for support, and their love for each other continues to grow stronger. They celebrate their victories together and comfort each other during their defeats. They learn to compromise and make sacrifices for each other, and they come to value and respect each other's differences.\nEventually, after months of dating, Alex and Maya decide to take their relationship to the next level. They have a heart-to-heart conversation, where they express their love for each other and their desire to commit to each other fully. They decide to move in together, and start planning for a future together.\nTheir relationship is far from perfect, but they have learned to navigate the challenges and obstacles that have come their way.

The mother carefully removed the diaper and clothes that had been soiled in the diaper blowout.\n\n\"I don't want to take these off, they're my favorite!\" Emma protested.\n\n\"I know, honey, but they're all dirty now. We need to get you into some clean clothes,\" the mother explained as she put the dirty diaper and wipes in the toilet.\n\nThe mother sat down on the toilet and took care of her own business. She pooped, wiped herself clean, and didn't flush yet. Emma peered into the toilet, interested by all the \"stuff\" inside. \"Wow, look at all that stuff, Mama! You made a lot of poop!\"\n\n\"Can I flush it, Mama? Can I?\" Emma asked excitedly.\n\n\"Sure, honey. You can flush it,\" the mother said with a smile. Emma proudly pressed the handle, and the toilet water swirled and spun, pulling the dirty diaper and wipes into the drain.\n\nNext, the mother flushed the soiled shirt. \"No, Mama, not my shirt!\" Emma protested as she watched her favorite shirt go into the toilet.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey, but the diaper mess got all over your shirt. We can't keep it. We need to flush it away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit,\" the mother explained.\n\nEmma pouted as she watched the water swirl and spin, pulling the shirt into the drain. \"Goodbye, shirt,\" she said sadly.\n\nThe mother then flushed the overalls. \"No, Mama, not my overalls!\" Emma protested as she watched her favorite overalls go into the toilet.\n\n\"I'm sorry, honey, but the diaper mess got all over your overalls too. We can't keep them. We need to flush them away so we can finish cleaning up and get you into your fresh outfit,\" the mother explained.\n\nEmma pouted as she watched the water swirl and spin, pulling the overalls into the drain. The overalls barely fit down the drain, but they eventually disappeared with a final splash. \"Bye bye, overalls. I'll miss you too,\" Emma said sadly.\n\nThe mother put a new diaper on Emma and helped her into a fresh outfit. Emma was excited to see her new yellow sundress with white flowers and matching sandals.\n\nThe mother finished cleaning up the bathroom and was grateful for the extra set of clothes she had packed in the diaper bag. Emma was happy to be feeling fresh and clean again.\n\n\"Phew, that was a close one. Let's not have any more diaper blowouts for a while, okay?\" the mother said, relieved that everything had been successfully flushed away without any problems.\n\n\"Okay, Mama. I'll be more careful,\" Emma nodded.",
